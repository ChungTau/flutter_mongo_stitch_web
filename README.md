# flutter_mongo_stitch_web

The web implementation of [flutter_mongo_stitch](https://github.com/kfiross/flutter_mongo_stitch)

## Usage

### Import the package

This package is the endorsed implementation of `flutter_mongo_stitch` for the web platform since version `0.7.1`, so it gets automatically added to your dependencies by depending on `flutter_mongo_stitch: ^0.7.1`.

No modifications to your pubspec.yaml should be required in a recent enough version of Flutter (`>=1.12.13+hotfix.4`):

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  flutter_mongo_stitch: ^0.7.1
  ...
...
```


## Web integration
From version 0.2.0, it's done under the hood :)
